# ELIXIR Metabolomics Community

This GitHub repository has been setup to collect input from the [Metabolomics Community](https://elixir-europe.org/communities/metabolomics). Initially for the [2018 ELIXIR Metabolite Identification implementation study](https://elixir-europe.org/about-us/implementation-studies/metabolite-identification), but later other ELIXIR implementation studies within the Metabolomics Community can continue/add more content when needed. Contributions are welcome via pull requests (PR), or by using the project's [issue tracker](https://github.com/elixir-metabolomics-community/project-information/issues).

## Metabolite identification
Metabolomics is the study of small molecule metabolites in the metabolome, which is the complete set of metabolites in a biological sample. By studying these metabolites, we can observe changes in cellular networks and biochemical pathways. This could allow us to detect disease states and their progression, monitor responses to therapy, stratify patients based on biochemical profiles, and highlight targets for drug design.

A major bottleneck for this rapidly-expanding field, however, is metabolite identification. Without a comprehensive data set of metabolites to compare against, the results of metabolomics experiments are often hard to interpret.

The goal of the ELIXIR Metabolomics Community is to work with experimental scientists and developers to provide the resources, analysis tools and infrastructure that will help metabolite identification. The community will also establish an infrastructure of services, standards and datasets to help researchers discover, annotate and analyse metabolomics data from around Europe.
